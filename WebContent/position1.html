			<p>Apple made the case today that its newly unveiled iPhone 5
				should take its rightful spot atop the smartphone food chain.</p>

			<p>But for seemingly the first time, it's not exactly a slam dunk
				that Apple's device belongs there.</p>
			<p>When the iPhone 4 debuted in June 2010, it was the phone to
				own. The Android phenomenon hadn't taken over yet, and Samsung
				Electronics was still finding its way. Established handset vendors
				Nokia and Research In Motion, meanwhile, were at the beginning of
				their quickly accelerating declines. The momentum was behind Apple
				and CEO Steve Jobs.</p>
			<p>Following a lengthier-than-expected upgrade cycle to the
				incrementally better iPhone 4S, and now the iPhone 5, things have
				changed. Android is pervasive, and Samsung now has a significant
				lead in the smartphone business with a franchise, the Galaxy S, that
				generates nearly as much buzz as the iPhone. Motorola is a part of
				Google. Nokia and RIM, meanwhile, are re-arming themselves with
				brand-new mobile platforms and are ready to fight to reverse their
				fortunes. And Tim Cook now has the reins of Apple.</p>
			<p>Most importantly, the iPhone is no longer leaps and bounds
				better than the competition and the obvious choice for consumers.
				Instead, rivals have caught up. The iPhone 5's main features -- a
				larger display, access to 4G LTE, and an improved camera -- can
				already be found on Android smartphones. For the first time, Apple
				can no longer stand apart from its smartphone competitors as a clear
				leader; it's right there in the middle of the fray.</p>
			<p>"Whilst the company is still reaping the rewards of the brand
				equity of the iPhone, consumers are notoriously fickle when it comes
				to buying handsets," said Ovum analyst Adam Leach. "Without the
				continued innovation which we are accustomed to with Apple, the
				company risks losing consumer appeal."</p>
			<p>While it may no longer be the obvious choice for smartphone
				buyers, the iPhone 5 will still shake up the market. Apple's cachet
				and its world-beating market presence still means every other
				company needs to watch out.</p>
			<p>The iPhone 5 debuted today at the usual hype-infused Apple
				event, with Cook and his team taking steps to reestablish the
				iPhone's leadership role in the world. Executives talked up the
				various upgrades and new features, with Cook working to leave the
				impression that Apple's products remain a step up from those of the
				competition.</p>
			<p>"Only Apple could create such amazing software, hardware, and
				services and put them together into such a powerful, integrated
				solution," Cook said at the event.</p>
			<p>But Cook certainly could have used the late Steve Jobs' famed
				reality-distortion field for this one. Jobs' strength of personality
				could have at least left the impression that the iPhone 5 was more
				revolutionary than evolutionary. Today's event had few exciting
				moments and even fewer surprising ones.</p>
			<p>In hindsight, the competition had it easy with the iPhone 4S,
				which launched last October but was largely seen as a placeholder
				until the arrival of the iPhone 5. It featured the same design as
				the iPhone 4 and only software and internal hardware improvements.
				Apple managed to juice sales by expanding its distribution to even
				more wireless carriers, but despite impressive sales, it clearly
				couldn't sustain the momentum or buzz of previous iterations of the
				smash-hit product.</p>
			<p>That left other high-profile phones to make their mark,
				including the Motorola Droid Razr and Samsung's Galaxy S3 and Galaxy
				Nexus.</p>
			<p>Apple's vulnerability is further illustrated by the shift in
				the market, which has moved in Samsung's favor. Samsung overtook
				Apple for the smartphone crown in the third quarter of last year and
				has only extended its lead. In the recent second quarter, Samsung
				owned nearly 30 percent of the global smartphone market, while Apple
				had 18.8 percent, according to Gartner. Apple managed only to eke
				out a gain, while Samsung nearly doubled its share.</p>

			<p>SEOULâ€”Samsung Electronics Co. 005930.SE +3.03% and Apple Inc.
				AAPL +1.40% are building patent portfolios of fourth-generation
				mobile-network technology, an area that is likely to become their
				next battleground over intellectual property.</p>
			<p>Telecommunications carriers world-wide are upgrading their
				networks to support more bandwidth for faster Internet access and
				data downloads on mobile devices. Smartphone makers meanwhile are
				speeding the rollout of handsets that support long-term evolution 4G
				technology.</p>
			<p>LTE promises faster data-transfer speeds than conventional
				third-generation networks. Samsung's latest smartphone, the Galaxy S
				III, supports LTE. Apple's iPhone 5, which the company unveiled
				Wednesday in San Francisco, also will support the technology.</p>
			<p>LTE is expected to become the next wireless-network standard,
				and holding a large number of patents for the technology could help
				companies shield themselves from potential litigation. The issue
				will be crucial for Apple and Samsung as they vie for leadership in
				the fast-growing smartphone market.</p>
			<p>The two companies are embroiled in more than 50 lawsuits
				spanning 10 countries. A U.S. federal jury last month awarded Apple
				$1.05 billion in damages, saying that Samsung violated six patents
				held by Apple. The South Korean company said it would appeal the
				verdict.</p>
			<p>Samsung held the largest number of LTE patents globally at the
				end of June, 819, up 21% from a year earlier, according to a Korean
				Intellectual Property Office survey of filings with the European
				Telecommunications Standards Institute. Apple held 318 LTE patents,
				up from none last year. Finnish handset maker Nokia Corp. NOK1V.HE
				+1.84% had 389.</p>
			<p>"It's highly likely that Samsung will use its stronger
				position in LTE technology to continue to fight against Apple in the
				ongoing litigation," said Kim Hyoung-sik, an analyst at Taurus
				Investment & Securities.</p>
			<p>The blow from Samsung's courtroom defeat in the U.S. hasn't
				diminished the company's appetite to continue, or even extend, its
				legal dispute with Apple, a person familiar with Samsung's thinking
				said. The "fine itself may not be a huge problem for Samsung, as it
				is expected to earn around 20 trillion won [or roughly $18 billion]
				in a year, but now, it all comes down to the matter of Samsung's
				reputation," the person said.</p>
			<p>Apple declined to comment.</p>
			<p>Apple acquired access to some 4G patents when it joined a
				consortium that bought Nortel Network Corp.'s NRTLQ -10.00% patent
				portfolio last year, giving the Cupertino, Calif., company potential
				weapons in a battle with Samsung.</p>
			<p>Still, both companies could struggle to gain a victory from
				patents related to wireless standards. The jury in California found
				that Apple didn't infringe Samsung patents related to 3G wireless
				standards because they were part of a chip made by Intel Corp., INTC
				-0.64% which had a license for the patents.</p>
			<p>Analysts said attempts by Samsung to use its new technology
				standard patents could come under scrutiny by antitrust regulators
				globally. The European Commission and South Korea's Fair Trade
				Commission are investigating whether Samsung abused its position as
				a market leader in 3G wireless technology. Samsung said it would
				cooperate with the European probe and declined to comment on the
				South Korean investigation.</p>
			<p>Industry rules dictate that electronics makers whose patents
				are part of technology standards must license them to other
				companies in a fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner. Such
				patents are typically given a low monetary value by electronics
				companies to increase the appeal of the technical standard and the
				likelihood of widespread adoption. But since the start of its
				litigation with Apple in April last year, Samsung has argued in
				courts world-wide that its standards-related patents are
				undervalued.</p>
