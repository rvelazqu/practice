		<div class="middle_box ">NEW YORK (AP) - The tablet-computer
			market is like guerrilla warfare. One huge army - Apple - dominates
			the land, while a ragtag group of insurgents keeps raiding and
			probing, hoping to find some opening it can exploit. With Samsung's
			new Galaxy Note 10.1, the rebels have scored a small victory. It's a
			tablet that does something that the iPad doesn't do, and it does it
			well. This victory won't win the war, though. Available in the U.S.
			starting Thursday, the $499 tablet comes with a pen, or more
			precisely, a stylus. It doesn't leave marks on paper, but the
			tablet's screen responds to it. I found it a pleasure to use: It's
			precise and responsive, and it glides easily across the screen. There
			are styluses available for the iPad, but they're not very good. The
			iPad's screen can't sense sharp objects, so any stylus has to be
			fairly blunt. Many of them have rubber tips, which resist being
			dragged across the screen. The Galaxy Note has an additional layer in
			its screen, tuned to sense special, sharp-pointed pens through
			magnetism. The Note is not the first iPad competitor to work with a
			stylus. The HTC Flyer came out last year with the same ability, but
			several missteps limited its appeal. First, it was half the size of
			the iPad yet cost just as much, and that was without the pen. Second,
			there was no slot for the pen in the body of the tablet, making it
			easy to lose. The pen also was expensive, costing $80 to replace.

			Samsung then built pen-sensitivity into the first Galaxy Note, a
			smartphone launched early this year. Though well-received, the tablet
			had an odd size, with a 5-inch screen. That makes it very big for
			smartphone but small for a tablet. With the Galaxy Note 10.1, Samsung
			is taking the pen squarely into iPad territory. So what can you do
			with the pen? Well, this is where the Samsung offensive starts
			faltering. There just isn't that much the pen is useful for, because
			stylus-equipped tablets are so new. You can jot down notes, or edit
			photos in an included version of Photoshop. You can scrawl personal
			notes to people and email them. Instead of using the on-screen
			keyboard, you can use handwriting and let the tablet interpret it.
			You can even enter Web addresses this way. Handwriting is slower than
			typing, and the tablet's interpretation introduces errors, so it's
			not clear why you'd use it much, though. The stylus senses how hard
			you press into the screen. Samsung's S Note app responds by making
			the line you make thinner or thicker, an essential feature for anyone
			who wants to use a tablet for serious drawing. The pen also comes
			with a side button that works much like the left mouse button, giving
			access to extra features with little effort. Very few third-party
			apps are designed with styluses in mind, but some of them work better
			with a stylus anyway. "Draw Something," a drawing game, is a good
			example. It's designed for use with fingers, but the stylus makes it
			much easier to draw intelligible pictures, because it's easier to see
			what you're drawing. By contrast, a finger is so big and blunt that
			it obscures the picture. The app would work even better if it sensed
			the pen pressure. At the current level of software support, the
			stylus is just slightly better than a gimmick. But even when there
			are more apps for it, the stylus is going to have limited appeal.
			It's a must-have for only a small group of people, who like to doodle
			or need to do so for their jobs. For the rest of us, it will be a fun
			thing we use once in a while. It can and should tip a purchase
			decision now and then, but not for everyone. You can contrast that
			with the signature feature of the latest iPad: the ultra-high
			resolution screen. That's not a must-have feature for everyone
			either, but it's immediately useful to everyone. The Galaxy Note does
			chip at the iPad's defenses with other features the Apple tablet
			lacks. One is a slot for microSD memory cards, which means you can
			expand the memory of the Galaxy Note inexpensively. That's very
			welcome. The other feature is an infra-red light, which can be used
			in place of a remote at the home entertainment center. This is a
			feature Sony pioneered in its Android tablets. It's welcome, too -
			some people spend hundreds of dollars on universal remotes, which the
			Galaxy Note effectively replaces with this feature. However, the
			included software didn't work well with my TV and stereo, so this
			will take some tinkering to get right. Compared with other tablets
			that run Google's Android software, you're not giving much up by
			getting a Galaxy Note. Samsung's quoted battery life of nine hours is
			somewhat shorter than equivalent models, possibly because of the
			pen-sensing layer or the new processor. The Note runs Ice Cream
			Sandwich, the next-to-latest version of Android, and can be upgraded
			to Jelly Bean, the latest. It has a fast processor and a big screen.
			At $499, it costs $100 more than the pen-less Galaxy Tab 2 10.1,
			which has the same size screen but a slower processor. The Asus
			Transformer series of tablets takes another tack: They're built to
			work with an accessory keyboard, which also contains an extra battery
			and more connection ports. That's another way a competitor tries to
			take advantage of a blind spot for Apple and the iPad, for which
			physical keyboards seem like an afterthought. Together, Asus and
			Samsung's strategies could add up to a very attractive tablet indeed.
			For now, and for most people, the iPad is still the better buy. The
			main reason is that there's much more, and better, third-party
			software available for it. But the Galaxy Note shows that the
			pressure is building on the iPad, and Apple will have to work if it
			wants to maintain its lead.</div>
